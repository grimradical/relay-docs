If you're using Relay for the first time, try running an [example workflow](example-workflows.md).

To start authoring your own Relay workflows, follow these steps:

1.  Create a source control repository for your workflows.
2.  [Integrate the repository](setting-up-relay.md#) using the [Relay web interface](https://nebula.puppet.com).
3.  (Optional) [Download and install the Relay command line interface](setting-up-relay.md#).
4.  [Create a workflow and run it](using-workflows/create-workflow.md).
