# Running reference workflows

The reference workflows in the library demonstrate various capabilities of the Relay system and provide good starting points for authoring your own workflows. Feel free to modify them, and if you come up with a useful change, please feel free to [send a pull request](https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay-workflows/)!

If you want to reset them back to the default state or explore more deeply, the source code for the workflows is kept in the [@puppetlabs/relay-workflows](https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay-workflows) GitHub repo.
